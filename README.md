# Multi Layer Perceptron , CNN and Transfer Learning

In this question, you will perform multi-class classification on animals data set (Alessio, 2018). Specifically, you will implement a neural network with two hidden layers to distinguish 10 different animals from each other. The dataset has been preprocessed in such a way that each class has 200 samples and each sample is an image of size 100x100x3.

Download the dataset from the following link:

In this repository, there are three different perspective for the classification problem that given above:

# - Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP)

# - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) 

# - Transfer Learning
